-> VoIP is an advanced technology that has replaced the conventional public switched telephone network (PSTN) in both corporate and home environments. 

-> VoIP uses Internet infrastructure to establish connections for voice calls; data are also transmitted on the same network. However, VoIP is vulnerable to TCP/IP attack vectors.

-> Through VoIP enumeration, attackers can gather sensitive information such as VoIP gateway/servers, IP-private branch exchange (PBX) systems, and User-Agent IP addresses and user extensions of client software (softphones) or VoIP phones.

***SvMap

-> Svmap is an open-source scanner that identifies SIP devices and PBX servers on a target network. It can be helpful for system administrators when used as a network inventory tool.

->  syntax:- svmap <target network range/IP Address>
