ldapsearch is a shell-accessible interface for the ldap_search_ext(3) library call
ldapsearch opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds it, and performs a search using the specified parameters
The filter should conform to the string representation of the search filters, as defined in RFC 4515
If ldapsearch finds one or more entries, the attributes specified by attrs are returned. If * is listed, all user attributes are returned. If + is listed, all operational attributes are returned
Attackers use ldapsearch to enumerate AD users. This allows attackers to establish connections with an LDAP server to perform different searches using specific filters.
