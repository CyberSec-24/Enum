-> DNS zone transfer is the process of transferring a copy of the DNS zone file from the primary DNS server to a secondary DNS server.

-> In most cases, the primary DNS server maintains a backup or secondary server for redundancy, which holds all the information stored in the primary server

-> The DNS server uses zone transfer to distribute changes made to the main server to the secondary server(s).

-> An attacker performs DNS zone transfer enumeration to locate the DNS server and access records of the target organization.

-> In DNS enumeration using zone transfer, an attacker attempts to retrieve a copy of the entire zone file for a domain from the DNS server. Attackers can perform DNS zone transfer using tools such as nslookup, dig command, and DNSRecon.

-> To perform a DNS zone transfer, the attacker sends a zone-transfer request to the DNS server pretending to be a client; the DNS server then sends a portion of its database as a zone to the attacker. 

-> This zone may contain a large amount of information about the DNS zone network.

-> Attackers use the dig command on Linux-based systems to query the DNS name servers and retrieve information about the target host addresses, name servers, mail exchanges, etc. 

-> Syntax:- dig ns <target domain>
-> Example:- dig ns 10.10.1.22

-> The below command sets the query type to the Start of Authority (SOA) record to retrieve administrative information about the DNS zone of the target domain certifiedhacker.com.

Syntax:- nslookup set querytype=soa <target domain> 

-> Attackers use DNSRecon to check all NS records of the target domain for zone transfers

-> Syntax:-  dnsrecon -t axfr -d <domain name>
-> Example:- dnsrecon -t axfr -d certifiedhacker.com

-> the -t option specifies the type of enumeration to be performed, axfr is the type of enumeration in which all NS servers are tested for a zone transfer, and the -d option specifies the target domain
