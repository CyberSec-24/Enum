-> DNS cache snooping is a type of DNS enumeration technique in which an attacker queries the DNS server for a specific cached DNS record. 

-> By using this cached record, the attacker can determine the sites recently visited by the user.

->  This information can further reveal important information such as the name of the owner of the DNS server, its service provider, the name of its vendor, and bank details.

-> Non-recursive Method:-
In this method, to snoop on a DNS server, attackers send a non-recursive query by setting the Recursion Desired (RD) bit in the query header to zero.

If the queried record is present in the DNS cache, the DNS server responds with the information indicating that some user on the system has visited a specific domain. 

Attackers use the dig command followed by the name/IP address of the DNS server, domain name, and type of DNS record file. The +norecurse option is used to set the query to non-recursive

Syntax:- dig @<IP of DNS server> <Target domain> A +norecurse

-> Recursive Method
In this method, to snoop on the DNS server, attackers send a recursive query by setting the +recurse option instead of the +norecurse option

In this method, the time-to-live (TTL) field is examined to determine the duration for which the DNS record remains in the cache. 

Here, the TTL value obtained from the result is compared with the TTL that was initially set in the TTL field.

If the TTL value in the result is less than the initial TTL value, the record is cached, indicating that someone on the system has visited that site.

Syntax:- dig @<IP of DNS server> <Target domain> A +recurse
