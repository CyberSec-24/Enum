-> The remote procedure call (RPC) is a technology used for creating distributed client/server programs.

-> RPC allows clients and servers to communicate in distributed client/server programs.

-> In general, RPC consists of components such as a client, a server, an endpoint, an endpoint mapper, a client stub, and a server stub, along with various dependencies.

->  Enumerating RPC endpoints enables attackers to identify any vulnerable services on these service ports. 

-> In networks protected by firewalls and other security establishments, this portmapper is often filtered

-> Syntax:- nmap -T4 â€“A <target IP/network>
