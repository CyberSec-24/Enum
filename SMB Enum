Server Message Block (SMB) is a transport protocol that is generally used by Windows systems for providing shared access to files, printers, and serial ports as well as remote access to Windows services
By default, SMB runs directly on TCP port 445 or via the NetBIOS API on UDP ports 137 and 138 and TCP ports 137 and 139. 
 By using this information, attackers can perform various attacks such as SMB relay attacks and brute-force attacks.
Attackers can also use SMB enumeration tools such as Nmap, SMBMap, enum4linux, nullinux, SMBeagle and NetScanTool Pro to perform a directed scan on the SMB service running on port 445

Syntax:-  nmap -p 445 -A <target IP> 
The STATE of PORT 445/tcp is OPEN, which indicates that port 445 is open and that the SMB service is running
command:- nmap -p 445 --script smb-protocols 192.168.187.208
