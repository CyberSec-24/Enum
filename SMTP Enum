Mail systems commonly use SMTP with POP3 and IMAP, which enable users to save messages in the server mailbox and download them from the server when necessary.
SMTP uses mail exchange (MX) servers to direct mail via DNS. It runs on TCP port 25, 2525, or 587.
SMTP servers respond differently to VRFY, EXPN, and RCPT TO commands for valid and invalid users; therefore, valid users on the SMTP server can be determined
Administrators and pen testers can perform SMTP enumeration using command-line utilities such as Telnet and netcat or by using tools such as Metasploit, Nmap, NetScanTools Pro, and 
smtp-user-enum to collect a list of valid users, delivery addresses, message recipients, etc. 
They enumerate the target SMTP server using various SMTP commands available with Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) script
Syntax:- nmap -p 25 –script=smtp-enum-users <Target IP Address>
command:- nmap -p 25 –script=smtp-enum-users 192.168.187.208
