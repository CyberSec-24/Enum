-> SnmpWalk is a command-line tool that allows attackers to scan numerous Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

-> SNMP nodes instantly and identify a set of variables that are available for accessing the target network

-> Using this tool, attackers target the root node so that information from all the sub-nodes such as routers and switches can be fetched. 

-> The information can be retrieved in the form of an object identifier (OID), which is part of the management information base (MIB) associated with the devices having SNMP enabled.

->Syntax:- snmpwalk -v1 -c public <Target IP Address>
-> Example:- snmpwalk -v1 -c public 10.10.1.11

-> Using this command, attackers can also retrieve all the data in transit to the SNMP server from the SNMP agent, including the server being used, user credentials, and other parameters.
