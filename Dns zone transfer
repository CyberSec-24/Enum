DNS zone transfer is the process of transferring a copy of the DNS zone file from the primary DNS server to a secondary DNS server.
The DNS server uses zone transfer to distribute changes made to the main server to the secondary server(s). An attacker performs DNS zone transfer enumeration to locate the DNS server and access records of the target organization.
In DNS enumeration using zone transfer, an attacker attempts to retrieve a copy of the entire zone file for a domain from the DNS server. Attackers can perform DNS zone transfer using tools such as nslookup, dig command, and DNSRecon
To perform a DNS zone transfer, the attacker sends a zone-transfer request to the DNS server pretending to be a client; the DNS server then sends a portion of its database as a zone to the attacker
Attackers use the dig command on Linux-based systems to query the DNS name servers and retrieve information about the target host addresses, name servers, mail exchanges, etc.

syntax dig ns <target domain>
command dig ns 192.168.187.208
