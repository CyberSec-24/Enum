Netbios enumeration

-> NetBIOS enumeration tools explore and scan a network within a given range of IP addresses and lists of computers to identify security loopholes or flaws in networked systems

-> Attackers use the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) for discovering NetBIOS shares on a network

-> The NSE nbstat script allows attackers to retrieve the target’s NetBIOS names and MAC addresses

-> NetBIOS Enumerator is an enumeration tool that shows how to use remote network support and to deal with some other web protocols, such as SMB

-> The nbtstat command “nbtstat –a <IP address of the remote machine>” can be executed to obtain the NetBIOS name table of a remote computer
(Above command is for the Windows)

Syntax:- nmap -sV -v --script nbstat.nse <target IP address>
Command:- nmap -sV -v --script nbstat.nse 10.10.1.22
